# 📰 Fake News Detection

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to detect whether a news article is **Fake** or **Real**. Built with Python, this system processes raw text, extracts features using TF-IDF, and trains classification models to identify misinformation.

## ✅ Project Highlights

- ✅ Clean and well-structured pipeline: Load → Preprocess → Feature Extract → Train → Evaluate  
- 🧠 Uses real-world dataset containing both fake and true news articles  
- 📊 Multiple classifiers tested (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)  
- 🧪 Accuracy up to **98%** depending on model  
- 📦 Modular code: easily extendable for deep learning or web deployment  
- 🛠️ Optional: Convert to a web app with Flask/Streamlit  
- 🔍 Ideal for learning NLP, text classification, and end-to-end ML pipelines
